# üè¶ Bank Management System

## Overview üìå
The **Bank Management System** project is a comprehensive solution to manage and analyze banking client data using **Excel**, **PostgreSQL**, **Python (Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook)**, and **Power BI**. The system allows seamless data import, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization to support business intelligence, customer engagement insights, and financial reporting.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Excel:** Data source for client information.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database to store and query data.
- **Python (Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook):** Data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and business intelligence reporting.

## üóÇ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation (Excel)**
   - Client data was collected and structured in Excel.
   - Columns included `ClientID`, `Name`, `Age`, `LocationID`, `JoinedBank`, `BankingContact`, `Nationality`, `Occupation`, `FeeStructure`, `LoyaltyClassification`, `EstimatedIncome`, `SuperannuationSavings`, `AmountOfCreditCards`, `CreditCardBalance`, `BankLoans`, `BankDeposits`, `CheckingAccounts`, `SavingAccounts`, `ForeignCurrencyAccount`, `BusinessLending`, `PropertiesOwned`, `RiskWeighting`, `BRId`, `GenderId`, `IAId`.

2. **Data Storage (PostgreSQL)**
   - Data was imported from Excel into PostgreSQL using the `Clients` table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Clients (
       ClientID VARCHAR(20),
       Name VARCHAR(100),
       Age INT,
       LocationID INT,
       JoinedBank DATE,
       BankingContact VARCHAR(100),
       Nationality VARCHAR(50),
       Occupation VARCHAR(100),
       FeeStructure VARCHAR(50),
       LoyaltyClassification VARCHAR(50),
       EstimatedIncome DECIMAL(15,2),
       SuperannuationSavings DECIMAL(15,2),
       AmountOfCreditCards INT,
       CreditCardBalance DECIMAL(15,2),
       BankLoans DECIMAL(15,2),
       BankDeposits DECIMAL(15,2),
       CheckingAccounts DECIMAL(15,2),
       SavingAccounts DECIMAL(15,2),
       ForeignCurrencyAccount DECIMAL(15,2),
       BusinessLending DECIMAL(15,2),
       PropertiesOwned INT,
       RiskWeighting INT,
       BRId INT,
       GenderId INT,
       IAId INT
   );
   
   SELECT tablename 
   FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   
   SELECT * FROM clients;
   ```

3. **Data Analysis (Python - Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook) üêç**
   -Data imported from PostgreSQL into Python using `psycopg2` and `pandas`.
   -Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and preprocessing.
   -Example code snippet:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import psycopg2
   
   conn = psycopg2.connect(
       dbname="bankdb", 
       user="username", 
       password="password", 
       host="localhost", 
       port="5432"
   )
   
   query = "SELECT * FROM Clients;"
   df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
   print(df.head())
   ```
4. **Analyses Performed** 
   - Customer segmentation by **income bands**
   - Calculation of **total deposits, loans, and fees**
   - Engagement metrics such as **customer retention duration**

5. **Dashboard Creation üìä (Power BI)**
   -Connected Power BI directly to the PostgreSQL database
   -Created new calculated columns using **DAX**:

   ```DAX
   Processing Fees = 
   SWITCH('Clients - Banking'[Fee Structure],
   "High",0.05,
   "Mid" ,0.03,
   "Low" , 0.01 , 0
   )
   
   Income Band = 
   SWITCH(TRUE(),
   'Clients - Banking'[Estimated Income] < 100000,"Low",
   'Clients - Banking'[Estimated Income] < 300000,"Mid",
   "High" )
   
   Engagment Days = 
   DATEDIFF('Clients - Banking'[Joined Bank],TODAY(), DAY )
   
   Engagement Timeframe = 
   SWITCH(TRUE(),
   'Clients - Banking'[Engagment Days] < 365 , "< 1 Years",
   'Clients - Banking'[Engagment Days] < 1825 , "< 5 Years",
   'Clients - Banking'[Engagment Days] < 3650 , "< 10 Years",
   'Clients - Banking'[Engagment Days] < 7300 , "< 20 Years",
   "> 20 Years")
   ```
### Key Measures Created in Power BI üìä

```DAX
Total loan = SUM('Clients - Banking'[Bank Loans]) + 
             SUM('Clients - Banking'[Business Lending]) + 
             SUM('Clients - Banking'[Credit Card Balance])

Total Fees = SUMX('Clients - Banking', [Total loan] * 'Clients - Banking'[Processing Fees])

Total Deposits = SUM('Clients - Banking'[Bank Deposits]) +
                 SUM('Clients - Banking'[Saving Accounts]) +
                 SUM('Clients - Banking'[Checking Accounts]) +
                 SUM('Clients - Banking'[Foreign Currency Account])

Total Clients = DISTINCTCOUNT('Clients - Banking'[Client ID])

Engagement Length = SUM('Clients - Banking'[Engagment Days])
```
